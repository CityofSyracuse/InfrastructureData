        <p>Much of the City of Syracuse's infrastructure has aged past its useful life. In order to tackle the issues in the most efficient and effective ways, the City is using data to documents and prioritize projects.</p>

        <h2>Infrastructure and the economy</h2>
        <p>Infrastructure is the backbone of the economy. It is the roads people commute on to get to work and the pipes that transport water so businesses can open. In New York City, sometimes people have to be evacuated from the subway following a water main break. In Syracuse, when infrastructure fails, water main breaks shut down restaurants, prevent people from taking showers, and destroy roads. </p>
        <p>While it is difficult to quantify the total cost of water main breaks or pervasive potholes, we know that the average repair cost for a water main break in Syracuse is about $7,000 multiplied over hundreds of breaks per year. This does not count the revenue lost for businesses that need to shut down for the day, or the challenges of living a day without water in a home. It <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2015/03/rough_roads_cost_syracuse-area_drivers_477_a_year_in_extra_vehicle_wear_group_sa.html" target="_blank">has been estimated</a> that rough roads in Syracuse cost drivers about $477 per year in damage to vehicles.</a>

        <h2>
          Reacting to water infrastructure problems
        </h2>
        <p>
          Syracuse delivers some of the cleanest water in the nation, but many pipes in the system date back more than 100 years. We know where water main breaks happen, and we can analyze where in the city there are a large number of water main breaks. Below, the blue dots show where each water main break has happened since 2004. The red shading shows where in the city the highest density of water main breaks have happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Downtown Syracuse is always a location for many water main breaks. There are other locations, like in the Northside neighborhood, where a large number of water main breaks happen as well.

    <h2>Proactively addressing water infrastructure problems</h2>
    <p>The City of Syracuse is good at reacting to infrastructure problems. Most water main breaks are fixed in around eight hours, and potholes that have been complained about are filled in about six days. Reacting to infrastructure issues, though, means the problems will continue, and the City will not do enough to fix the problems before they happen.</p>
    <p>Addressing water infrastructure proactively is difficult because the pipes are below ground and cannot be seen without digging into the earth. Using new data analysis techniques and 21st century technologies, can help the City see the system's weaknesses without digging.</p>
    <p>Mayor Stephanie Miner has championed the use of data in helping to direct city operations. This vision is part of the reason the city received grant funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies to launch an Office of Innovation. Additionally, the City of Syracuse hired its first Chief Data Officer in March, 2016, the first city in New York State to name a Chief Data Officer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h3>Predictive Models</h3>
    <p>We can use the history of water main breaks, and the attributes of water mains, to inform which pipes might be most risky in the future, getting new information from existing data.</p>
    <p>The City of Syracuse's Office of Innovation researched the causes of water main breaks, met with water crews, and learned about the difficulties of determining water main risk. Based on these challenges, the team, along with the City's Chief Data Officer pursued a partnering with the <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship</a> in summer, 2016. We worked to build a predictive model that tells us which water mains have the highest risk of breaking in the next three years. If we chose 50 blocks in the city at random, we would expect about 5 of them to have a water main break on them by the end of 2018. Using this model, <strong>the top 50 riskiest blocks in the city should have 32 water main breaks on them by the end of 2018.</strong></p>
    <p>The map below shows where the top 50 (red) and top 500 (yellow) riskiest blocks are in the city. The blue dots show where water main breaks have happened so far this year. The model is not perfect, but it gives us better intelligence about our water mains at a full city-scale than ever before.

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p>Knowing where water mains are riskiest is not just important for City operations, but it impacts the residents and businesses in the city. The map below shows the riskiest 50 blocks of water mains, as well as the buildings on each of those blocks. When a water main break happens, a restaurant will be forced to close, or a family won't be able to use water to cook, or shower. Using data to help operations ultimately saves money and hassle for the city and its residents.</p>
      <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="100%" height="400" src="./assets/parcelMap.html"  frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Leak Detection Sensors</h3>
    <p>Sensors placed on water mains listen to the flow of water through the pipes. Leaks are detected when that consistent sound changes. The City of Syracuse began piloting various water main sensors in the downtown neighborhood of the city in spring, 2016, based on data analysis that showed breaks happen most frequently in the Central Business District. The objective from the pilot is that the City will be able to detect small water main leaks before they turn into breaks, and can then fix the problem with less disruption to homes and businesses in the area, and less destruction of the road when digging into the ground.</p>
    <p>In order for the sensors to work, pipe length, diameter, and material needs to be known. Documenting these attributes helps to ensure that when crews dig into the ground - both from the Water Department and other agencies - workers will know what is below the ground, eliminating any "peek and shriek" possiblities.
      <img class="img-responsive center-block" width="50%" SRC="./assets/SensorMap.png">
      <p>The pricing of these sensors varies from vendor-to-vendor, but the City could place sensors on all of the water mains downtown for around $50,000. Cities like South Bend, Indiana have partnered with local universities to help build sensors to monitor infrastructure. South Bend has sensors on their sewer systems to warn when they are filling too quickly. The sewage is then diverted so overflows are minimized. This low cost option, like that of water sensors, offer high potential for savings as well as better maintenance of the system, and are attainable by smaller and larger cities, alike.</p>

        <h2>Reacting to Road Problems</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
      <p>
        Syracuse has more than 500 miles of roads, and each year they degrade thanks to age, weather, and more. The City provides people an opportunity to <a href="http://cityline.syrgov.net/" target="_blank">complain</a> about issues in the city, like the presence of potholes on roads. Waiting for people to complain, though, is reactive. It means someone's car might have been damaged when driving over a pothole.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can see where people complain about potholes most. The red dots on the map below are a selection of pothole complaints so far in 2016.
      </p>
    </div>
      <div class="row">
      <img class="img-responsive center-block" width="50%" SRC="./assets/potholecomplaints.png">
      </div>
      <p>Not all potholes are reported, so depending on complaints exclusively will leave potholes unfilled. In order to be less reactive and more proactive, the City needed to come up with ways to better discover road deficiencies using technology and data.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h2>Proactively Addressing Road Problems</h2>
        <h3>GPS tracking</h3>
        <p>Until 2016, the City of Syracuse only tracked when potholes were complained about, and when those specific potholes were filled. The department of public works (DPW) fills many more potholes, they just weren't tracked.</p>
        <p>Additionally, DPW rated the quality of roads every year. This was done on a 1-10 scale, and while the rating system worked well, it was somewhat subjective since a person was doing the ratings.</p>
        <p>Finding ways to track all the potholes filled, and automating the collection of road quality ratings would help to make operations more proactive. GPS units were put on all DPW vehicles in 2015, and each time the pothole filling machines filled a pothole, a row of data was logged to track the time and location of that pothole. Immediately, the City was tracking thousands of potholes being filled. The map and chart below show where and how many potholes have been filled since GPS tracking started in Arpil, 2016.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="img-responsive center-block" width="50%" SRC="./assets/PotholesFilled.gif">
        </div>
        <h3>Street Quality Identification Device</h3>
        <p>To supplement the road rating process, the City began working with a company called <a href="http://www.argolabs.org/blog-1/?category=squid">Argo Labs</a> in April, 2016, and using their product, SQUID. IT is a low-cost computer, attached to a vehicle, that measures the bumpiness of a road using an accelerometer, and photographs the street with an attached camera. Logging the hundreds of miles of roads gives more information about the quality of the road.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="img-responsive center-block" width="50%" SRC="./assets/squid.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>Supplementing existing information about roads and potholes with these new methods of collecting data will allow the City to address roads proactively. Using all of the data related to roads, the City should be able to predict how many potholes will appear after a harsh winter, and how much paving should be done to maintain the quality of the City's roads overall. This analysis is similar to the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/25/the-nate-silver-of-infrastructure" target="_blank">work done</a> by Lucius Riccio, the former commissioner of city transportation in New York City, also known as "Professor Pothole".</p>

      <h3>Dig Once Collaborations</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimately, piecing information together about roads, water mains, and other pieces of infrastructure, allows the City of Syracuse to plan the construction work that should be done in the future, collectively. Many agencies dig into the roads, but using data-driven methods as well as increased enforcement, the City should be able to fix problems proactively, collaborate on projects and time them appropriately, and limit the number of times construction happens on a road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaboration seems like it should be easy. But infrastructure projects are expensive, need a lot of planning, are dependent on weather, and sometimes pieces can fall through which can put the entire project at risk. Add to that the fact that city agencies, like the department of public works, water department, and engineering department, need to work with private utilities like the gas and electric company and phone and internet companies. Competing interests can make collaboration difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        With an ultimate goal to increase the number of Dig Once projects where multiple agencies fix infrastructure while only opening the road once, the City should spend money more efficiently, and the infrastructure should be improved incrementally so each piece of infrastructure is updated before the end of its useful life. The map below shows where various infrastructure systems need updating. Using Geographic Information Systems, the City can determine where there are potential conflicts or opportunities for partnership for projects over the next five years.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" width="50%" SRC="./assets/5yearplan.PNG">
      </div>

      <p>
        Using these new methods of data analysis and 21st century technologies gets the City of Syracuse on this path, which other cities can use as a model for their own infrastructure improvement processes.
